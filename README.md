With a clean, modern interface, YAPER brings you the familiar features of today’s messaging apps—like replies, user mentions, and display names—while remaining lightweight and easy to use. It’s completely open-source and multi-platform, running smoothly on Windows, Android and even IOS, Whether you're offline or just want to stay hyper-local, YAPER gives you a fast, private, and community-focused way to chat anywhere you are. And the best bit? messages aren't stored on a server meaning once everyone closes the app, the messages disappear from the app.
